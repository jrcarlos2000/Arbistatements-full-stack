# **Arbistatements** - Arbitrum Hackathon, Bogota.
## What is Arbistatements ? 
Arbistatements is inspired in the semaphore protocol, which uses Zero Knowledge to prove that users are part of a group and send signals anonymously. The Protocol receives funds from users who want to generate **Arbistatements**, and these funds are invested in lending platforms such as aave. 
## How it works ?
- Users join our protocol by paying a small fee , one per address.
- Users are able to link each address to their identity commitment
- Identity commitments are composed of Name + Birthdate + Password + Passport Number
- Users are able to generate **Arbistatements** by paying a fee and proviving the right identity commitments.

## Inspiration ?
The need to generate Crypto statements without writting your address in the document, by just providing the assets held by address and some of the previous transactions.
